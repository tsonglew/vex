## Best Practices

### Connection Management

1. **Connect when needed:** Only connect to servers you're actively working with
2. **Disconnect when done:** Close connections to free up resources
3. **Monitor status:** Use refresh to check connection health

### Error Recovery

1. **Check credentials:** Verify username/password are correct
2. **Verify server:** Ensure server is running and accessible
3. **Network issues:** Check firewall and network connectivity

### Performance

1. **Limit connections:** Don't keep unnecessary connections open
2. **Regular cleanup:** Disconnect from unused servers
3. **Status monitoring:** Use refresh sparingly to avoid overhead

This comprehensive connection management system provides users with full control over their vector database connections while maintaining clear visual feedback about connection status.
